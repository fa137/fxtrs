To start using ionic, you have two options: copy over the built JS and CSS files, or
use the `ionic` tool ([ionic-cli](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli)) which can be installed through npm: _(You may need to prefix the command with `sudo` depending on your OS and setup.)_

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

then run the following command within the project folder:
```bash
$ ionic serve
```

it will open up the application in your default browser.
